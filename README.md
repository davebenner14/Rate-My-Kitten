For my second project at my software engineering bootcamp I am making a cat ranking web app.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate our newly learned skills from unit 2: Node, Express, Mongoose, APIs and CRUD along with skills learned in unit 1: CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

Rate My Kitten was built in one week.
